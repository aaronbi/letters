Dear Doctor Alto Clef,

This message contains very important and sensitive information. I trust that only you will be able to decode it.

So anyway, last week I went shopping with Doctor Placeholder McDoctorate for a new umbrella and you won't believe who I ran into! It was the tall guy from our old MTF squad! He still blabbing on and on about the heliospheric mega structure he supposedly visited and how its going to destroy earth. Command said they did a sanity check on him, but personally I think he should get checked again. Ever since he went to the epicenter in epsilon 6a's pocket plane, somethings been wrong in his head. I say its about time they increase their standards on who they declare sane or not.

In other news, tomorrow is the day we finally start testing on Scranton's time machine! Finally I'll have something to do other than the super secret monitoring of Doctor Jack Bright. Honestly I have no idea why O5 is still making us do this. Scranton knows. Bright knows. Literally everyone knows. If O5 wants something out from Bright they should just confront him. Its not like he can stand against O5.

Anyways, I gotta prepare some reality anchors so testing with Scranton's machine doesn't literally destroy everything. Hopefully the island will still be intact when you get here. When you do get here meet me by the south entrance. I'll let you skip some security checks. Also, tell Scranton the day before you come. He might fire the potato cannon at you if you don't.
